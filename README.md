# jscss

Compiler tool for creating CSS files by incorporating inline Javascript.

## JUSTIFICATION

The goal of JSCSS is to allow users to create CSS files with lots of speed and flexibility. It is similar to Sass in this way. However, JSCSS uses JavaScript syntax for all of it's extended functionality beyond vanilla CSS. In a finished state, it would be able to utilize both CSS and JavaScript code/libraries.

## SETUP

Install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or via command line.

  Bash: 
  ```
  curl "https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-${VERSION:-$(wget -qO- https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/ | sed -nE 's|.*>node-(.*)\.pkg</a>.*|\1|p')}.pkg" > "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" && sudo installer -store -pkg "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" -target "/"
  ```
  Powershell: 
  ```
  winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
  ```

Other JavaScript runtimes should be able to run the compiler but I recommend Node.js.

## USAGE

The compiler can be run with `node jscss.js <input-filename>`.
The input file must have the extension `.jscss`, and the compiler will create a CSS output file in the root directory with the same name as the input file. 

In an input file, `$` represents the start and end of a code block. Below is a sample of what a `.jscss` file could look like. See the examples directory for more.
```
body {
    text-align: center;
}
    
h1.double {
    border-width: $10*20/50$px;
    border-style: double;
    Border-color: green
}
    
h1.double2 {
    border-width: $1+1$px;
    border-style: double;
    Border-color: green
}

h1.double3 {
    border-width: 15px;
    border-style: double;
    Border-color: green
}
```

would compile to:

```
body {
    text-align: center;
}
    
h1.double {
    border-width: 4px;
    border-style: double;
    Border-color: green
}
    
h1.double2 {
    border-width: 2px;
    border-style: double;
    Border-color: green
}
$log "howdy"$
h1.double3 {
    border-width: 15px;
    border-style: double;
    Border-color: green
}
```

and would also print "howdy" to the console.

## CURRENT STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION

To see the grammar and details for what the finished implementation of this project would look like, it's in the next section.

### Quirks

Since the project is unfinished, there are some minor issues I'll cover here. First off, CSS files generated by the compiler have unnecessary newlines in places where a code block is used outside of a piece of CSS. Secondly, despite allowing typical JavaScript blocks, nesting, etc., the scope of every piece of code is always global. 

Most critically, the current implementation does not parse any CSS, and doesn't validate whether or not it's valid. There is also virtually no error handling for the JavaScript portion either.

### Grammar

jscss -> chunk* EOF

chunk -> cssBlock* | codeBlock*

***Note that a ccsBlock can include any CSS syntax with the exception of any use of "$". A cssBlock also does not have to be standalone valid CSS, since codeBlocks can exist within CSS classes, properties, etc., splitting what would be a valid block of CSS standalone.***

codeBlock -> "$" declaration* "$"

declaration -> letDecl | statement

letDecl -> "let" IDENTIFIER ("=" expression)? endOfStatement

statement -> expressionStatement | ifStatement | logStatement | whileStatement | block

endOfStatement -> (";") | NEWLINE

expressionStatement -> expression endOfStatement

ifStatement -> "if" "(" expression ")" statement ("else" statement)?

logStatement -> "log" expression endOfStatement

whileStatement -> "while" "(" expression ")" statement

block -> "{" declaration* "}"

expression -> assignment

assignment -> (IDENTIFIER "=" assignment) | logicalOr

logicalOr -> logicalAnd ("||" logicalAnd)*

logicalAnd -> equality ("&&" equality)*

equality -> comparison (equalityOperator comparison)*

equalityOperator -> "!=" | "=="

comparison -> term (comparisonOperator term)*

comparisonOperator -> "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">="

term
